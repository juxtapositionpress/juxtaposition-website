# Vale

Vale is a weirdo from the suburbs. They write poetry about small happinesses, being mixed-race, mental illness, and the making of community. By day they work in office admin. By night they suffer from Does Too Many Things Syndrome. You can read their poetry in Rest for Resistance, Room, FEELS Zine, Living Hyphen, and QT Lit Mag. You can read their anime reviews on Wordpress. And you can occasionally see them tell jokes at open mics.
