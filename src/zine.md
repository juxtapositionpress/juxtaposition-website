# Zine

**Zine submissions are OPEN: Submit by March 16th**

The Juxtaposition zine publishes writing by members of the Juxtaposition collective.

We aim to create a space where trans, non-binary, and Two Spirit writers can share and enjoy each other’s work, including (but not limited to!) poetry written in our in-person writing circles and workshops.

Anyone who attends a Juxtaposition event or joins our [online community](https://discord.gg/NKeCFrTck7) is welcome to submit their work. Deadlines for the next issue to be announced soon.

## What to Submit

We are seeking poems, flash fiction, and critical review essays.

### What kinds of poetry?

Any kind! Metre and rhyme, free verse, visual, blackout–we take it all!

A poetry submission is up to 75 lines of poetry (~3 poems) and we will print
a maximum of 50 lines (~2 poems). So yes: send more than we'll print! This lets
us curate the zine's feel.

### What is flash fiction?

Fiction under 450 words qualifies as flash fiction. Send us 1 or 2 pieces. We
will publish a maximum of 450 words of prose.

### What is a critical review essay?

Write about a piece of media from your unique trans perspective! Up to 450 words.
