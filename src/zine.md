# Zine

The Juxtaposition zine publishes poetry of all kinds by members of the Juxtaposition collective.

We aim to create a space where trans, non-binary, and Two Spirit writers can share and enjoy each other’s work, including (but not limited to!) poetry written in our in-person writing circles and workshops.

Anyone who attends a Juxtaposition event or joins our [online community](https://discord.gg/NKeCFrTck7) is welcome to submit their work. Deadlines for the next issue to be announced soon.

## What to Submit

We are seeking poems, flash fiction, and critical review essays.

### What kinds of poetry?

Any kind! Metre and rhyme, free verse, visual, blackout–we take it all!

### What is flash fiction?

Fiction under 500 words qualifies as flash fiction.

### What is a critical review essay?

Write about a piece of media from your unique trans perspective!
