# Writing Circles

We run a drop-in writing circle at the [ArQuives](https://arquives.ca/) on the second Thursday of each month from 6pm to 8pm. The writing circles are a friendly social space to connect with others and get some words on the page. Expect a few writing prompts and opportunities to share what you've written. If you are interested in joining us, please rsvp [here!](https://writingcircle.eventbrite.ca/)

Attendees to the writing circles are encouraged to submit their favourite pieces to our [zine!](/zine/) We dedicate a few pages in each issue to material from the writing circles.
