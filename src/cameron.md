Cameron DePutter is a queer and trans storyteller. An avid zine-maker since the ‘90s, a lifelong diarist, and a lover of making stuff, Cameron has been writing since he could hold a pencil, and self-publishing since he could staple paper together. In his storytelling business, Cameron uses his communications skills to help people express themselves effectively and authentically. He is the author of two books, Share Your Story: A Workbook, and Little Poems for Big Hearts. You can find his name (and his deadname) in a lot of other people’s books — often credited as an editor, storytelling partner, co-writer, or acknowledged as a ghostwriter through secret handshakes.
